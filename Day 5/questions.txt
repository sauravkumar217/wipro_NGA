1. Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of lambda expressions to sort a list of strings in reverse alphabetical order. Then, implement a functional interface StringProcessor with a method process(String str) that takes a string and returns its uppercase version. Use this functional interface in conjunction with a lambda expression to process a list of strings and print their uppercase forms.
 
Hint: Use List.sort(), lambda expressions, and String::toUpperCase

2. Given a list of employees, each with a name, age, and salary, write a Java program using the Streams API to:
 
Filter employees who are older than 30.
Find the average salary of employees who meet the age condition.
Collect the names of these employees into a List.
Print the list of employee names and the average salary.
Hint: Use filter(), map(), collect(), and average() methods from Streams
